            <h2>THE POINTS SYSTEM</h2>
            <p1>
                Golf consists of a point system that must maintain its consistency throughout.
                Simply put, the player begins their first shot at the tee box. Throughout the hole, each 'hit' of the ball is counted and at the end of the hole, the total number of
                shots is tallied and added to the overall score. At the end of the game, the totals of each hole are tallied and the final score is calculated. The player with the lowest score
                (least amount of points) is crowned as the winner.<br>
                Each hole has a specific par. The par is the amount of strokes that a player is expected to make on each hole. This number is determined by the difficulty of the hole, according
                to the course's standards. For example, lets say hole 4 is a par 3. This means that the player is expected to make 3 strokes to sink the ball.<br>
                To improve your golf jargon:<br>
                1 shot under par is called a birdie. 2 shots under par is called an eagle.<br>
                1 shot over par is called a bogey. 2 shots over par is called a double-bogey.<br>
                And obviously, a single shot to sink the ball is called a hole in one.

            <h2>BALL POSITIONING</h2>
            <p1>
                A key rule in golf is to play the ball as it lies.<br>
                This rule basically means that a player cannot touch or move the ball once it is in play. However this rule <br>
                has its exceptions, which will be explained later in detail.<br>
                Similarly, a player must play the course as it is. <br>
                A player cannot move anything on the course nor alter the position of obstacles to their advantage.<br>
                Each golf course has a specified tee-off area for the player to hit their first shot. Depending on the golf course,<br>
                each tee-box is differentiated from the next based on colour. For example, children will tee-off from the yellow<br>
                tee-box and men will play from the red. This matters because each tee-box is a different distance from the next.<br>
                ie. The kids tee-box is much closer to the hole than the men's tee-box because they are expected to play at different<br>
                standards. <br>

            <h2>COURSE</h2>
            <p2>
                Boundaries:<br>
                Golf courses consist of bounds marked by different objects such as stakes, ropes or fencing.<br>
                Once the ball exits these boundaries, it is considered out of bounds and the player must re-take<br>
                their shot from the exact same position and consequently lose a point, or as we say, 'drop a shot'.<br>
                Obstructions:<br>
                Every hole on a golf course consists of conditions that are placed to make the game more challenging.<br>
                These conditions consist of objects that are classified as either natural or man-made. Natural elements <br>
                such as leaves, tree branches and stones can be moved out of the players path because these obstacles have not<br>
                been strategically placed, but are simply in the way.<br>
                Man-made obstacles such as stakes, ropes or signposts can be moved if they are hindering the player from <br>
                making their desired stroke.<br>
                Unplayable Areas:<br>
                These areas include water hazards(lakes, ponds, etc) or areas out of bounds.<br>
                Once a player's ball enters unplayable areas, they have the option to re-take their shot and lose a point, or<br>
                the player can place their ball in the designated drop-zone and play from there, but they must still lose a point.

            <h2>COMPETITION</h2>
            <p1>
                Golf is a gentlemen's sport, thus there is specific etiquette to be expected.<br>
                Some general etiquette that i follow is to allow the player who had the best core on the previous hole to play first<br>
                on the next hole. And throughout the hole, after teeing off, the player whose ball is farthest from the hole must<br>
                play first.

            <h2>BALL IN PLAY</h2>
            <p1>
              As stated earlier, a player cannot touch or move the ball while it is in play. If a player accidentally touches the ball<br>
              while it is at rest, that will count as a shot and will be added to the tally. Similarly, if a player obstructs the ball<br>
              while it is moving, a penalty is incurred.
